# todo-vue

vue todo list app taken from https://github.com/bradtraversy/vue-crash-2021 course.
See youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZXt1Aom3Cs for the basic vue
course.

Then watched the https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lVQgZzLMHc state management
and enhanced the todo to use that instead of all the event emit and passing
task data stuff around.

then migrated to vite using helpful video from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8epzPrsADI
